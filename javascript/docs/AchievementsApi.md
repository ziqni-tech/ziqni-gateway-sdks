## getAchievements

> AchievementResponse getAchievements(X_API_KEY, spaceName, opts)

Returns a list of achievements

Returns a simplified list of available Achievements.  This assumes that achievements have first been created using the web console. Otherwise no data is returned and the value of the \&quot;totalRecordsFound\&quot; variable in the metadata section of the response is 0.  GET responses can be filtered out based on the achievement parameters to narrow down the results.  &#x60;Requesting a list of Achievements a response will show Achievements that are in Live state and/or Expired.&#x60;   &#x60;Achievements that are in Draft state or Deprecated - will not be displayed.&#x60;   Include query parameter options are:  &#x60;?_include&#x3D;ruleSets&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;dependantOn&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;products&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;metadata&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;rewards&#x60;  or multiple at the same time: &#x60;?_include&#x3D;products,metadata,ruleSets,dependantOn,rewards&#x60;

## getMemberAchievementsByRefId

> AchievementResponse getMemberAchievementsByRefId(X_API_KEY, spaceName, memberRefId, opts)

Returns a list of achievements by member ref id

Returns a simplified list of available Achievements.  This assumes that achievements have first been created using the web console. Otherwise no data is returned and the value of the \&quot;totalRecordsFound\&quot; variable in the metadata section of the response is 0.  GET responses can be filtered out based on the achievement parameters to narrow down the results.  &#x60;Requesting a list of Achievements a response will show Achievements that are in Live state and/or Expired.&#x60;   &#x60;Achievements that are in Draft state or Deprecated - will not be displayed.&#x60;   Include query parameter options are:  &#x60;?_include&#x3D;ruleSets&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;dependantOn&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;products&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;metadata&#x60; &#x60;?_include&#x3D;rewards&#x60;  or multiple at the same time: &#x60;?_include&#x3D;products,metadata,ruleSets,dependantOn,rewards&#x60;
